**Bikeshedding: Placing too much importance on trivial things.**  
  
Today I found a blog post from a former Local Government colleague of mine, all about _“bikeshedding”_, or the [Parkinson’s Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality) to give it its official name.

Bikeshedding is a term to explain the phenomenon of focus being placed on a trivial part of an overall solution, while ignoring the main goal, or as Chantele puts it:

> …too much effort is put in to areas that have little or no bearing on the functionality of the end product.

As a developer I certainly have experienced that trivial little piece of functionality that wont go away, and as a manager I’ve seen this happening from time to time with my employees. I am very pleased that I’ve found a name for it.
