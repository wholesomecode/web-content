MoSCoW is a great way to prioritise your tasks, and an essential part of any [agile project managers toolkit](https://wholesomecode.ltd/blog/agile-project-management/).

MoSCoW stands for:

*   Must Have
*   Should Have
*   Could Have
*   Won’t Have

Here is what you do.

1.  Plot your tasks on a graph with importance on the x axis and urgency on the y axis.
2.  Divide your graph into four quadrants.

After you have done these, look at where your tasks are located.

*   The top right quadrant contains tasks that you **Must Do**
*   The top left quadrant contains tasks that you **Should Do**
*   The bottom right quadrant contains tasks that you **Could Do**
*   The bottom left quadrant contains tasks that you **Won’t Do**
