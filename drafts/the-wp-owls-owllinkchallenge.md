When WP Owls asked me to come up with a block-based tutorial for their site, I decided to give them not one, but two solutions. 

I recreated their link block (the owl link) [using a Block Pattern](https://wholesomecode.ltd/register-a-block-pattern-in-the-wordpress-block-editor-gutenberg), and then I created a standard REACT based block.

[Read my article over at WP Owls](https://wpowls.co/articles/creating-a-custom-block-for-wp-owls/).

WP Owls then challenged other people to submit their own solution:

And of course, what good is a Twitter based challenge, without a catchy hashtag?

So, are you up for the  [#OwlLinkChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OwlLinkChallenge) ? Let me know what you build.
